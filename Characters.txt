Life:
	- human female, 28 years old
	- born in April 2055 (human colony - Proxima Centauri B)
	- lived a good life until 16, then she finished building her own refurbished spaceship and started wondering around the world.
	- always had a great talent for tech
	- worked as a mercenary on many occassions, became invaluable to any team as a head mechanic
	- they say she once built a handgun and radio transmitter from things she found around, when she was held as a captive after a failed mercenary attack. One day the guards found her cell empty. By the time she was already on another planet.
	- in year 2077 (ya, I know, I'm also hyped for Cyberpunk) she met the player. They were both mercenaries at the time, both trying to assassinate a notorious gang leader in the Gliese 163 system, but both working under a different contractor. Raze had not so much luck with the assassination, earning a scar on her face. Right then player had to intervene and assassinate the gang leader, who was holding a gun against Raze's head. Needless to say, Raze felt grateful for being rescued. Player and Raze after that had some bounties together, but split up in the following year.
